"""
Copy of immutable and mutable objects

the '=' operator is used to copy objects. BUT it does not create a new object, it only creates a new variable that share reference to the original object

Mutable objects: means that if we change the value of this object, then the address of this object will not be changed

Immutable object: means that if we change the value of this object, then the address of this object will be changed 

Mutable: list, dictionary, set
Immutable: integer, float, boolean, tuple, string

shallow copy: will create new and independent object with same content
deep copy: creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.
